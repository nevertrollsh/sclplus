# SCL+
SCL+ or sclplus is a library for Swordigo which makes modding Swordigo easier!

## Math
The Math library in SP is an interesting libary which adds several functions i.e:
1. Math.Pow(n, to)
2. Math.Sqrt(n)
3. Math.Floor(x,y)
4. Math.Ceil(x,y)
5. Math.Square(n)
   
These functions are pretty self explanatory.
